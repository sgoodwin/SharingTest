# SharingTest
A simple project to illustrate the issue of trying to get a Sharing Extension to activate in Finder for markdown and plain text files.

## How to use:

1. Open up the Xcode project.
2. Build and run the "Share" target.
3. Select "Finder" (or any app really) as the host application.
4. Try to share markdown files, if things are working you will see "Share" as an option in the Share menu.
5. IF this works, try to share movie and image files, these should not show "Share" in the menu's options.
